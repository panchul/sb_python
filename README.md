# sb_python

Sandbox for Python programming, templates and reusable snippets

This repository could be a useful starting point for writing scripts, or demoing how to write scripts.
It could be used on its own, or deployed on a virtual machine within the workspace [https://github.com/panchul/workspace](https://github.com/panchul/workspace)

The `/doc` folder of the `workspace` repo has the documentation. 

I will gradually migrate the notes I have to this repository.
